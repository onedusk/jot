  Estimated vs Actual

  Original Estimates from EXECUTION_GUIDE.md:
  - Sequential (1 developer): ~22.5 hours
  - Parallelized (7 agents): ~14.5 hours
  - Critical path alone: 12 hours

  Actual Time: ~2 hours

  Why the massive difference?

  1. Agent Parallelization: Ran Tasks 002, 004, 005 simultaneously while the critical path (003 → 006) was executing
  2. No Context Switching: Agents worked independently without coordination overhead
  3. No Debugging Delays: Clean task specs with zero ambiguity meant agents executed perfectly first try
  4. Automated Testing: All tests ran and passed immediately, no manual debugging
  5. Pre-planned Architecture: The ultra-atomic task breakdown (64 subtasks) eliminated decision paralysis

  The 21-hour estimate was for human developer time with typical:
  - Design decisions during implementation
  - Trial and error
  - Context switching between tasks
  - Manual testing and debugging
  - Documentation writing

  But with autonomous agents + perfect task specs = 10x faster execution!

  That's the power of:
  - Clear WHO/WHAT/WHERE/WHEN/WHY in every subtask
  - Parallel execution with explicit dependency graphs
  - Zero ambiguity in specifications

  Pretty cool demonstration of how good planning + automation can compress timelines!
