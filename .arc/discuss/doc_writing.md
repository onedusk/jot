due to jetbrains deprecating the Writerside IDE, then turning it into a plugin, of which, is buggy as shit...

going to (in its most simple form) create a new concept project in hopes that it is not as buggy, is easy to use, runs from the command line, and is easy to install.
and accomplishes the same objective/goal as Writerside. of which, goes as follows:

- aggregates *.md files project wide, preserving the original file structure and metadata.
- generates a xml table of contents in root of directory
- when ready, allows the compilation of the project into a web-application/web-archive of html files linked to together to then form full documentation of the project that can be deployed

will require the application of global variables / css styles / javascript / etc.

initial thoughts land on the following:
- use golang and gin for the project
  - reasoning is because it compiles into a binary that can be run on any platform with web support built-in and is easy to deploy
- Use a simple (in-house) version control system for tracking changes
- auto-track changes in a similar fashion to CI/CD pipelines ( via something simple, like this -- [event broadcasting](/Users/macadelic/Desktop/grove-db/agents/lokee) )
- make this extremely LLM / Agent / AI friendly
- allow global and granular searching capabilities across documentation (browser-indexing as well as search engine indexing)

## MVP Design Documents Created

The Hive Mind has completed the MVP design phase. The following comprehensive documents have been created:

1. **[MVP Design Document](./jot-mvp-draft.md)** - Complete technical specification including:
   - System architecture and technology stack
   - Core features and implementation details
   - API design and configuration schema
   - 8-week implementation timeline

2. **[Implementation Roadmap](./jot-implementation-roadmap.md)** - Practical development guide with:
   - Week-by-week development plan
   - Code structure and examples
   - Testing and deployment strategies
   - Community building approach

3. **[LLM Features Specification](./jot-llm-features-spec.md)** - Detailed AI/Agent integration:
   - Structured data export formats
   - Vector embedding support
   - Agent-specific APIs
   - LangChain and OpenAI integrations

## Next Steps

1. Review the MVP documents and provide feedback
2. Set up the initial Go project structure
3. Begin implementation following the roadmap
4. Create a GitHub repository for collaboration
