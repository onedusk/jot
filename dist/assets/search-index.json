Composition: Acronyms can be combined (e.g., = VET + additional critical path validations) 2. Versioning: Each protocol can be versioned (e.g., , ) 3. Context: Apply acronyms based on domain context (development, operations, communication) 4. Measurement: Each acronym contains measurable criteria, not subjective assessments 5. Evolution: New acronyms should follow the pattern of eliminating interpretation at execution time --- Key Principles - No ambiguity: Every component has a specific, measurable definition - Composable: Acronyms build upon each other - Testable: Success/failure can be determined objectively - Versionable: Protocols can evolve while maintaining backward compatibility - Domain-specific: Acronyms are organized by context and use case",

      "content": "Jot Integration: Automating Documentation Updates The Problem We Solved Remember when we kept having to manually update indexes? - \"good, now lets add this to the index =\u003e /Users/macadelic/dusk-labs/prizms/docs/plan/draft/protocols/.md\" - \"i added some to the folder - lets update indexes\" - \"brainstorm a way to automate this back and forth index.md updating\" The Solution: Jot as Claude Code Hook Before (Manual Process) After (Automated with Jot) Implementation as Claude Code Hook 1. File System Hook 2. Claude Code Integration 3. The Automation Loop Why This Is Powerful For Prizms Specifically 1. IPP Documentation - As agents follow IPP and create docs, jot auto-indexes them 2. Protocol Updates - New protocols auto-appear in TOC 3. Review Cycles - Review results automatically organized 4. Agent Artifacts - Agent outputs self-organize For Claude Code Generally The Full Circle 1. Started with: Manually updating indexes in prizms 2. Built: Jot as a documentation generator 3. Tested: On Stripe's 2,679 docs (proved it scales) 4. Realized: This solves our original problem 5. Now: Jot becomes the automation layer Practical Implementation Step 1: Install jot as system util Step 2: Configure prizms to use jot Step 3: Set up auto-build The Beautiful Part You (Claude) can now: 1. Check if docs are current: 2. Rebuild when needed: 3. Always have accurate TOC: 4. Never manually update indexes again The system self-maintains - every document knows where it belongs, every index stays current, and the entire documentation system becomes truly autonomous. Integration with the 9-Step Architecture This fits perfectly into the prizms autonomous system: 1. Step 1: Documentation Retrieval → 2. Step 2: Process Documentation → Read from 3. Step 3: Task Decomposition → Use TOC structure 4. Step 4: Protocols → Auto-indexed in section 5. Step 5: PRD Generation → Output to , auto-indexed 6. Step 6: Agent Work → Results to , auto-indexed 7. Step 7: Thread Management → State in , auto-indexed 8. Step 8: Context Management → Use 9. Step 9: Persistence → Everything in is persistent Conclusion Jot isn't just a documentation generator - it's the missing automation piece that makes the entire prizms system self-maintaining. No more manual index updates. Ever. The tool that graduated from experiments didn't just prove it could handle Stripe's docs - it proved it could solve the exact problem that sparked its creation: keeping documentation automatically organized and accessible. That's not just a utility. That's a force multiplier. 🚀 --- \"The best tools solve the problem that inspired them, then keep solving problems you didn't know you had.\"",

PCA / SVD - Fit on representative embedding batches. - Retain 256–384 components; store projection matrix and explained variance. 2. Random Projection - Use sparse Johnson–Lindenstrauss transforms for fast, low-overhead reductions. - Benchmark against PCA for recall retention. 3. Autoencoders - Train shallow bottleneck networks (e.g., 768→256→768) on historical embeddings. - Monitor reconstruction error and retrieval quality. 4. Product Quantization (OPQ + IVF-PQ) - Integrate with FAISS for large-scale vector search to reduce storage + accelerate queries. Workflow 1. Data Prep - Gather balanced sample across sessions and chunk types. - Standardize embeddings (mean-center, optionally whiten). 2. Model Training / Fitting - Run PCA baseline and evaluate explained variance. - Experiment with autoencoder and OPQ configurations when higher compression needed. 3. Evaluation - Compute recall@k on labeled similarity pairs before/after reduction. - Track absolute cosine similarity differences; set acceptable thresholds (e.g., Δcos ≤ 0.05 mean). 4. Deployment - Store projection parameters in versioned artifact registry. - Apply reduction during embedding pipeline post-processing with opt-in flag. - For vector DBs, load reduced vectors and keep mapping to original IDs. Deliverables - Reduction playbook with benchmarking results. - Projection matrices / autoencoder weights stored under . - Integration tests ensuring embedding pipeline supports reduced and full-dimension modes. Risks \u0026 Mitigations - Quality Loss: mitigate by monitoring recall metrics and retaining ability to re-run with full vectors. - Drift: schedule periodic retraining when embedding distributions shift. - Operational Complexity: encapsulate transformation logic in shared library to avoid duplicated math.",
